Feature: Out of memory error support

Scenario: Big OOM without the OOM bootstrapper
  Given I start the laravel fixture
  When I navigate to the route "/oom/big"
  Then the Laravel response matches "Allowed memory size of \d+ bytes exhausted \(tried to allocate \d+ bytes\)"
  When I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Bugsnag Laravel" notifier
  And the exception "errorClass" matches one of the following:
    | Symfony\Component\ErrorHandler\Error\FatalError       |
    | Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\FatalErrorException |
  And the exception "message" matches "Allowed memory size of \d+ bytes exhausted \(tried to allocate \d+ bytes\)"
  And the event "metaData.request.httpMethod" equals "GET"
  And the event "app.type" equals "HTTP"
  And the event "context" equals "GET /oom/big"
  And the event "severity" equals "error"
  And the event "unhandled" is true
  And the event "severityReason.type" equals "unhandledExceptionMiddleware"
  And the event "severityReason.attributes.framework" equals "Laravel"

Scenario: Small OOM without the OOM bootstrapper
  Given I start the laravel fixture
  When I navigate to the route "/oom/small"
  Then the Laravel response matches "Allowed memory size of \d+ bytes exhausted \(tried to allocate \d+ bytes\)"
  And I should receive no requests

Scenario: Big OOM with the OOM bootstrapper
  Given I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_REGISTER_OOM_BOOTSTRAPPER" to "true"
  And I start the laravel fixture
